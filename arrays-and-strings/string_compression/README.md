# String Compression

## Question

Implement a method to perform basic string compression using counts of repeated characters. For example aabcccccaaa would
become a2b1c5a3. If the "compression" string would not become smaller that the original string your method should return 
the original string. You can assume the string has only upper case and lowercase letters.
