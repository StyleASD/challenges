## Question
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the
end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the true length of the string. (Note: if implementing in
java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place)

### Example

input: "Mr John Smith    ", 13

output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
