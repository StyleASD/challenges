# Partition

## Question

Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater
than or equal to x.

IMPORTANT: the partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the
left and right partition

## Output

The additional spacing in the example indicates the partition

input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1  [partition = 5]

output: 3 -> 1 -> 2      ->     10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
